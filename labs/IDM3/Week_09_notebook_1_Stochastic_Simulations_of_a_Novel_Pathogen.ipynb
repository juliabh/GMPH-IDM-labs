    "So far in this course, we have only been working with deterministic models, where we get the same output every time we run the model with a given input. This week, you have been introduced to the concept of stochasticity, or random events, in modelling. Random events can be particularly important in determining the course of an epidemic at the beginning of the outbreak, when only a few people are infected. This is what you will be exploring in this exercise.\n",

    "We are modelling introduction of a novel pathogen into a completely susceptible population. In the cells below, we have provided you with the R code for a simple stochastic SIR model, implemented using the \"GillespieSSA\" package. This package allows you to quickly set up a Gillespie algorithm, like the one you heard about in the video. While we won't cover how to code a stochastic algorithm in R here, we will provide you with external resources on this at the end of the course if you are interested to learn more. For now, the focus is on understanding the behaviour of stochastic models, and how this compares to that of deterministic models!\n",

In many situations, we also want to know what the **incidence** of infection is - how many people have become infected in a given time period. In our model output, the cumulative incidence is just the total number of infections that have occurred by a given point in time. For example, if 1 person becomes infected on day 1 and 2 people become infected on day 2, then the cumulative incidence at day 2 equals 3.\n",

If you save the function output in a variable, it will also show you the cumulative incidence by 100 days (or by the time the epidemic goes extinct, if this happens before 100 days). Load this function now by running the cell below. We also need to define a new vector of initial conditions, to save the cumulative incidence as an output. Of course, at the beginning of the simulation, the cumulative incidence is 0."
