This folder will be the Single Source of Truth for all the lab items (which are currently all ungraded labs) in the GMPH-IDM course and ultimately also related courses (i.e. MPH IDM, and IDM MOOCs). 
The structure contained within should be reflected in the labs in Coursera. Each set of four weeks has its own lab - IDM1, IDM2, IDM3.

NB Terminology: (Nov 2022)
Coursera uses the term "lab" to mean both lab items and the overall "lab" in which they are contained...
I imagine they intended for any confusion to be mitigated by the use of "ungraded lab" / "graded lab" to indicate specific items.
