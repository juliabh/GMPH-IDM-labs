    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've completed the previous etivity, you should now have a working function which takes in data and parameters for an SIR model and calculates the sum-of-squares for the model fit. This is now a function which you can put into ```optim()``` to find the $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ for the best SIR model fit to a dataset, as measured by least squares.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using ```optim()```:  \n",
    "You can use ```optim()``` without having to install any packages: it is in the ```stats``` package, which comes with your R installation anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's usually informative to check the help page to see what a function requires:"

    "```par``` : initial values for the parameters to be optimised over  \n",
    "```fn```  : a function to be minimised  \n",
    "\n",
    "So ```optim()``` takes a function (which you provide in the ```fn``` argument) for which it needs to find the minimum (or maximum) value. The output value of the function depends on the values of the parameters, which ```optim()``` will change as it works through the optimisation process; you need to give it some starting values in the ```par``` argument.  \n",
