    "In our previous SIR model, we have assumed a closed population, i.e. one where no one dies and no babies are born. In terms of the epidemic dynamics, that has meant that as more and more people become infected and recovered, the pool of susceptibles continually decreases, and thus so too does the effective reproduction number. This is fine for diseases with short infectious periods, that spread through a population more quickly than the population is able to renew itself. But what about longer timescales? In this etivity, we want to incorporate births and deaths into the basic SIR model. The structure for this model looks like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, copy-paste the SIR model code you have developed before, and extend it to capture this population turnover process. In the first instance, we are looking at an acute disease epidemic introduced into a fully susceptible human population. The infection and recovery rates are 0.4 and 0.2 days$^{-1}$ respectively. We can calculate the background mortality rate based on the average human lifespan - let's assume that this is 70 years, so *mu* = 1/70 years$^{-1}$, or 1/(70x365) days$^{-1}$. In this example, we are also assuming that the population size stays constant over time at 10$^{6}$ - to achieve that, we set the birth rate b = *mu*.\n",

    "The examples we have modelled here can be compared to real-world diseases. An acute disease that causes a pattern of epidemic cycles in human populations like in the first example is measles. The second example on the other hand is more comparable to endemic swine flu on pig farms, where pigs enter and leave the farm in a matter of weeks (hence the 'average lifespan' that you modelled, of 4 weeks).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the basic SIR model is very simple and does not account for many of the factors that can affect disease dynamics in reality. For example, measles notifications data from the pre-vaccination era suggest that epidemic oscillations did not flatten out over time like in our model. This tells us that there are other processes that sustain these cycles, that we have not included in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question: Can you think of other drivers for epidemic cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "This etivity was also your first look at a simple demographic process with births and deaths. As you might have noticed, the population size in this example stayed constant over time. However, if we were to model the demography of a country over time, an increasing population size is usually more realistic. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question: How would you change the birth and death rate to model a growing population? What other factors could drive population growth?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this etivity, we also made the assumption that all babies are born susceptible. Of course, this is not always the case in reality: maternal antibodies can confer immunity to newborns, neonatal vaccination can make newborns immune to infection, and some infections can be transmitted from mothers to their children, like HIV. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question: How would you adapt the differential equations to model a disease where a proportion *p* of babies born to infected mothers are infected at birth? Write them out on paper.\n",
