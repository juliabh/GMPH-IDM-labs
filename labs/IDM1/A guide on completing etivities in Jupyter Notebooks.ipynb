    "All coding etivities in this course use the R programming language, built into a third-party interface called Jupyter Notebooks. This document you are reading right now is a Jupyter notebook! This interface has the advantage that we can write out the instructions and explanations, but also give you an interactive space for coding. You can work on this online, without having to download any software.\n",

    "This is the main thing you need to know to complete etivities in this course. We give you the etivity instructions written within an interactive Jupyter notebook, interspersed with cells where you can fill in your own code. The solution file to each etivity is provided as a non-interactive \"read-only\" notebook - this means it will look the same as a notebook, but you cannot make changes to the code. \n",

This will leave all your code written in the cells, but you have to start running it again from the beginning. Altneratively, at the end of an etivity you can chose the \"Restart & Run All\" option, to run the complete code in the entire notebook from the beginning. These options can be useful if at any point you overwrite the content of a variable for example - the notebook will always store the content specified in the cell you executed/ran most recently!\n",
