    "In this group work, you will explore several other model structures and investigate how different assumptions about the natural history of a disease can influence model outputs. For each of the three model structures and corresponding parameter values shown below, R<sub>0</sub> = 2. Look at these and, within your group, first discuss questions 1-3. Then, choose one model for each member of your group to code. Based on questions 4 and 5, compare your model outputs to each other. \n",

    "### 2) Together, interpret and write down what each parameter represents in the different models, and calculate the missing parameter values based on the given information.\n",

    "*Hint: For each of the three models, you could consider generating additional plots to explore the effect of varying parameter values on the model output.  Observing how the transmission dynamics are affected by higher or lower values of $r$ (model 1), $p$ (model 2) and $\\delta$ (model 3) might give you insights into why some outputs from the three model structures are different.*"
