    "In the first week, you gained first experience with coding simple models in R using the deSolve package. Last week, you went into further details about the drivers of an epidemic and the dynamics of the SIR model. This week, we are bringing this together to think more deeply about the roles of $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$.\n",

    "### Question: Imagine a disease where every person infects 1 person on average, every 2 days, and is infectious for 4 days. What are the values for $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, when looking at the dynamics of an epidemic, we have always plotted the number of people in each compartment. Sometimes however it is more informative to look at the proportion of the population in each compartment rather than the actual number, particularly if the population size changes over time. Although we are modelling an epidemic in a closed population with constant population size in this etivity, it is a good opportunity to practice plotting the prevalence as a proportion of the total population who are in the S, I and R compartments. To do this, it is helpful to first think about which variables you need to calculate this at each timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model the epidemic with the $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ values you calculated above, assuming introduction of a single infected person in a totally susceptible population of 1 million. Remember you can go back to your model function file from week 1 and copy-paste the SIR code you have previously developed. You might also have to try different durations to run the model for. Then plot the proportion of susceptible, infected and recovered people over time.\n",

    "In your code above, vary $\\gamma$ with $\\beta$ held constant at 0.1 days$^{-1}$. Notice that there are some values where the initial infected case fails to cause an epidemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question: Assuming $\\beta$ equals 0.1 days$^{-1}$, what value of $\\gamma$ do you need in order to get an epidemic? In real life, what could give rise to such a change in $\\gamma$?\n",
